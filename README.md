## Limitations
- no knowledge of acronyms and proper names

## Credits
All rules used here were obtained from the excellent website https://titlecaseconverter.com/, created by Matthias Belz. I highly recommend the website as it contains a lot of valuable information and also recognises and corrects some inaccurately spelt proper names and acronyms.
